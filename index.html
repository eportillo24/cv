    <p>Welcome to my website! As you can see in see in my bio, it says I am a developer and a pastor-well
      I am not quite exactly there yet, with either of those titles. But I do know that I will reach those
      achievements in due time. And although one may be an achievement, the other is a callin from the Lord
      upon my life. I write this small summary about me so you get to know me. This will be my first creation
      of a website as I set course on my computer science pathway. There is still much to learn but I am starting
      here. Once again, welcome to my website and hopefully by the time you read this I'm somewhat of a more
      advanced developer. God bless you all!</p>
